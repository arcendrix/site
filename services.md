We build small internal tools that solve one operational problem really well.

## Common builds
- Field log → invoice generator
- Job tracker (status, notes, photos)
- Equipment hours + maintenance tracker
- Simple dispatch board
- Quote builder / estimator
- Inventory & reorder tracker

## What you get
- A branded web tool
- A simple backend (usually Google Sheets)
- A GitHub repo you own
- Clean print-ready outputs (PDF / invoice pages)

## Pricing (keep it simple)
Most tools fit into:
- **One-off build**
- **Build + monthly improvements**

If you want “cheap,” you’ll get trash. If you want “fast and solid,” we can do that.
